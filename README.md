# VoteChain

Votechain is a decentralized Voting System implemented on Polygon Blockchain. We are providing solutions/services to the ones who want to organize elections. Currently we only have Ad-hoc system implemented and planning to implement all the existing Voting Systems.

## Tech Stack
- Solidity
- Hardhat
- React
- NodeJS

## Challenges we ran into

- The very first challenge is that we were all new to Blockchain. This is the first ever app on blockchain for us.
- Sorting out how to optimally write the Smart Contracts.
- Integrating the Smart Contracts with User Interface.
- Finding a way to optimise the gas fees.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully wrote efficient Smart Contract and deployed it on Polygon.
- Came up with a revenue model that will lead to free/minimum gas fees for voters.

## What's next for
- Completing the ad-hoc voting system first.
- Implementing the optimised gas fees protocol.
- Implementing other voting methods.
- Cross Linking with other blockchains like Tezos, Mana etc.

**Happy _building_!**
