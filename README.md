# VoteChain

Votechain is a decentralized Voting System implemented on Polygon Blockchain. We are providing solutions/services to the ones who want to organize elections. Currently we only have Ad-hoc system implemented and planning to implement all the existing Voting Systems.

## Tech Stack
- Solidity
- Hardhat
- React
- NodeJS

## Challenges we ran into

- The very first challenge is that we were all new to Blockchain. This is the first ever app on blockchain for us.
- Sorting out how to optimally write the Smart Contracts.
- Integrating the Smart Contracts with User Interface.
- Finding a way to optimise the gas fees.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully wrote efficient Smart Contract and deployed it on Polygon.
- Came up with a revenue model that will lead to free/minimum gas fees for voters.

## What's next for
- Completing the ad-hoc voting system first.
- Implementing the optimised gas fees protocol.
- Implementing other voting methods.
- Cross Linking with other blockchains like Tezos, Mana etc.

### Gas Fee Reduction Protocol Ideas
- Snapshots
    - After certain time/count of votes, a snapshot of all total votes of the particular proposal will be updated on the main net.
- Resource Pooling
    - As stated in the conviction model, the more amount of tokens and the longer you stake, will determine the voting power you have. During these locking period, the user will not be able to access the locked tokens.
- Use of Biconomy
    - Any ERC20 token can be accepted as a stalking option and with the use of Biconomy the voter will pay free/minimum fees.
- Minimum Organizer's Fee
    - Certain amount of fee would be deduced from the organizer's stalking funds, to ensure maximum participants of the voters.

**Happy _building_!**
