# VoteChain

Votechain is a decentralized Voting System implemented on Polygon Blockchain. We are providing solutions/services to the ones who want to organize elections. Currently we only have Ad-hoc system implemented and planning to implement all the existing Electorial System.

## Tech Stack
- Solidity
- Hardhat
- React
- NodeJS

## Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```
sh
git clone https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate.git
cd hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```
sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```
sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```
sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

> Note: There's [an issue in `ganache-core`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/issues/650) that can make the `npm install` step fail. 
>
> If you see `npm ERR! code ENOLOCAL`, try running `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.

## User Guide

- [Hardhat's full documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)

For a complete introduction to Hardhat, refer to [this guide](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview).

## Whatâ€™s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a Dapp powered by Hardhat and React.

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/): An Ethereum development task runner and testing network.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/): A JavaScript test runner.
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/): A JavaScript assertion library.
- [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/): A JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum.
- [Waffle](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/): To have Ethereum-specific Chai assertions/mathers.
- [A sample frontend/Dapp](./frontend): A Dapp which uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Troubleshooting

- `Invalid nonce` errors: if you are seeing this error on the `npx hardhat node`
  console, try resetting your Metamask account. This will reset the account's
  transaction history and also the nonce. Open Metamask, click on your account
  followed by `Settings > Advanced > Reset Account`.
